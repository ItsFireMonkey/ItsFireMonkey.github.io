Script:

CN - Yeah?

KB - Can you turn down the music.

CN - What?

KB - Can you turn down the music!

KB - I'm trying to get some sleep here!

CN - Turn down the music?

CN - How's that!

CN - How's that. Is that much better?

KB - Turn down your damn music, or I'll come over there and turn it down myself!

CN - All right, sucker. You come down here, we can dance.

CN - Hello?

CN - Hello?

CN - Bitch!

KB - When I don't get enough sleep, I get irritable. And you don't want to make me -

'Calling VAGAN'

CN - Wait! Who are you?

KB - Just a bean trying to get some sleep.

CN - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

CN - You came here just to make us turn off the music?

KB - If you were listening on the phone,

KB - I said I would come here to turn it off myself.

CN - What!

CN - Are you insane?! Do you know what you just got yourself into?

CN - Do you know who I am!

CN - Do you know who my uncle is?!

KB - Yes.

KB - I do.

PB - Detective Cromwell. Good morning.

DC - Yeah.

DC - Something tells me there's nothing good about this morning.

DC - What do we got here?

PB - Multiple gunshots were reported coming from this warehouse.

PB - I was the first one to answer the call.

DC - Multiple gunshots, huh.

DC - You do know whose warehouse this is.

PB - Yes, sir.

DC - Have you gone inside yet?

PB - No, sir. I wanted to wait for backup.

DC - Well.

DC - It's here.

PB - My God.

PB - What a massacre.

PB - There's got to be a dozen, at least a dozen dead beans here.

DC - I guess I don't need this anymore.

PB - These were all Cappuccino's beans.

DC - Mm-hmm.

PB - It must have been some kind of gang war.

DC - No. This is no gang war.

DC - Cappuccino's beans might be dumb, but they know how to use a gun.

DC - There would have been other dead beans here, not just them.

DC - This something else.

PB - Well.

PB - One thing's for sure.

PB - We won't need that search warrant we were trying to get, huh.

DC - Heh.

DC - Yeah.

DC - I could live with this.

PB - Detective Cromwell. I found something here.

'This bullet casing is the property of Killer Bean'

DC - Killer Bean

'The bullet is meant for someone else'

DC - Hmm.

PB - What do you make of this?

DC - This guy's got balls. That's for sure.

PB - We got company!

DC - Let's go!

DC - Stop!

DC - Stop right there!

PB - This is the police! Hold it right there!

DC - Bad idea.

PB - Get out of the car! Get your hands where I can see them!

PB - Easy... Easy...

VN - Oh please, officer. Don't hurt me.

PB - Watch it.

DC - Vagan.

VN - I should have known I'd find you here, Detective Cromwell.

DC - What are you doing here, Vagan?

VN - Well, obviously something happened in my warehouse.

VN - I mean, can't a bean protect his own property anymore?

DC - Don't you mean, Cappuccino's property?

VN - You know, your obsession with Cappuccino has become quite amusing.

VN - Always trying to link everything back to Cappuccino.

PB - Why don't you tell it to the court. You're under arrest.

VN - Arrest? For what?

VN - A traffic violation?

PB - What about this? Looking for some action here?

VN - If I were looking for some action,

VN - you wouldn't be standing before me as you do right now.

PB - Yeah?

PB - That's cause I'd be shooting you with this!

DC - Are you kids done yet?

PB - I say we take him in and book him right now.

VN - You know my lawyers will have me out even before you get me to the police station.

VN - The time is not worth your effort, now is it Cromwell.

DC - Let him go.

PB - What?!

DC - I said let him go.

VN - Uh, my gun please.

VN - Nice...

DC - You know, Vagan, you're right.

DC - You're not worth my time.

DC - However, investigating the multiple homicides in your warehouse is.

DC - And whatever else we find in your warehouse, is just icing on the cake.

DC - You're free to go.

DC - And by the way, your car's parked illegally.

DC - You better get it out of here before we tow it.

DC - Oh, and Vagan.

DC - Here.

DC - It looks like I'm not the only one after your boss.

RP - ...possible suspects. Rumors have surfaced saying that there is a vigilante bean in town...

KB - What the hell is going on out there?!

KB - Ah. Looks like I got someone's attention.

KB - Who's this?

KB - Great.

KB - Playtime's over.

'Encrypted Call'

'Decoding'

'Secure Connection'

KB - This is Killer Bean.

SA - Killer Bean. What the hell are you doing? You think this is a game?

SA - What were you thinking last night?

KB - I had a rough night last night.

SA - We know what kind of night you had. Might I remind you what your mission is.

SA - You were given specific orders to hunt down and eliminate the target. No one else!

SA - Drawing this kind of attention to yourself is dangerous for us, and especially for you.

KB - What's the big deal? I killed a bunch of gangsters.

KB - I'm sure the Beantown police are a lot happier without them.

SA - You didn't do anyone a favor with that mess you created last night.

SA - And you are not working for the Beantown police.

SA - You are working for us!

KB - I'll still get the job done.

KB - I'll get him.

SA - We're running out of time. He has to know you're coming by now.

SA - Remember who he is.

KB - Yeah. I know what the mission is.

SA - Then stick to it! Don't be so reckless, Killer Bean.

KB - I'll call you when I got him!

KB - Reckless! Pff!

KB - Reckless my brown bean ass!

'Decoding'

'Secure Connection'

JB - Yes?

SA - Jet Bean, you have been activated for an urgent mission in Beantown.

JB - Beantown? I'm a long way from Beantown.

JB - It would be best to assign someone else.

SA - This mission is highly sensitive.

SA - You are the most capable for the job.

JB - It figures.

JB - Fine.

JB - I'll do it.

SA - Good. We'll contact you with the details as soon as you reach the shore.

SA - See you in Beantown.

JB - They better have some good food in Beantown.

BB - Wait.

BB - Are you leaving?

JB - Yes.

BB - How long will you go for?

JB - A long time.

BB - Oh...

BB - I have something I want to give to you.

JB - Oh... You shouldn't have.

BB - Here! It's the bill!

BB - You haven't paid in three months!

JB - I'm leaving now.

JB - I will pay when I get back.

BB - Hey! You get back here pay now!

BB - Tsingtao!

BB - Get out here!

BB - He say your food tastes like ass crack.

TT - What?!

BB - Make bean curd out of him!

JB - I said I'll pay when I get back!

BB - Oh. It's okay.

BB - It's on the house. You don't have to come back! Please!

CO - Looking at the figures from our previous fiscal year.

CO - Narcotic sales have dropped 57 percent.

CO - 57 percent!

CO - That's more than half!

CO - Now, compare this to the 300 percent growth

CO - from our weapons department.

CO - But you guys...

CO - You guys are not from my weapons department, are you.

CO - No...

CO - You guys are from my narcotics department, okay?!

CO - So what do I have to do, huh?

CO - How can I get through to you guys?!

CG 1 - Dude. I have such a hangover.

CG 2 - Yeah bean, that was a kick-ass party last night, right?

CG 1 - Yeah. Too bad we didn't stay for the whole thing.

CG 1 - I bet they had some fun.

CG 2 - Woot! Woot!

CO - You see, it's easy when you think about it.

CO - Crime is on the rise, okay. So more guns sell,

CO - because criminals use guns.

CO - Hello!!

CO - They also use drugs!

CO - So more drugs should sell, right?

CO - What's the problem here?

CO - Now, you guys.

CO - Someone give me a reasonable explanation, okay?

CO - Why are narcotic sales performing so poorly?

CG 3 - It's all those anti-drug commercials on TV.

CG 3 - You never see any anti-gun commercials.

CG 3 - It's not fair.

CO - It has become quite apparent to me,

CO - that some of you do not value your job.

CO - Now...

CO - That is quite odd, if you ask me.

CO - Especially in today's economy.

CO - But I am forced to say...

CO - It is time...

CO - To lay off!

CO - A few beans!!

CG 4 - Ooohhh!!!

CG 5 - Uh, wait.

CG 5 - I have a question.

CO - Yes.

CG 5 - Will I be eligible for unemployment?

CO - Hmm.

CO - Let me check with the finance department on that, okay?

CG 5 - My social security number is...

CG 5 - 3, 4, 6...

CO - Oh boy.

CO - Is my batting average going to go up after this.

CO - Ahem-

CG - Hang on, let me just finish this level.

VN - Cappuccino!

CO - Ah. Vagan.

CO - I'm glad you're here.

CO - Maybe you can teach these beans something about business,

CO - since you've handled my weapons department so well.

CG 1 - That bean is nothing but a kiss-ass brown-noser.

CG 1 - What does he know that we don't know?

CG 1 - But he's making millions of dollars selling weapons.

CG 1 - If you ask me,

CG 1 - He's doing something illegal.

CO - Oh, it's great to see you, Vagan.

CO - But you'll have to excuse me.

CO - I'm in an important meeting right now.

VN - This is more important. It's about the warehouse on Baker Street.

CO - Oh that. It's okay. I know.

VN - You know?

CO - Yeah. My nephew was having a party of there last night, okay?

VN - No, it's not about the party.

VN - Well.

VN - It is.

VN - There was a hit on the warehouse.

VN - Everyone is dead.

CO - Who did this.

VN - I have reason to believe that it was done by a bean named, Killer Bean.

CO - Killer Bean...

CO - One bean?

VN - This is no ordinary bean.

VN - I've heard of him before. I know what he can do.

CO - Who the hell is he?

CO - Who sent him?

CO - Is it the Colombians?

CO - Is it the French trying to roast me?

VN - It has to be one of your competitors.

CO - Who ever it is,

CO - I want you to find him.

CO - I want you to find him, and destroy him!

VN - Oh, believe me I will try.

VN - But first, we have Killer Bean to deal with.

VN - He's somewhere out there, and he's coming after you.

CO - All right.

CO - We need to consolidate all of our warehouses.

CO - There's too many targets for him to attack.

CO - Move all our inventory to the central warehouse on Main Street.

CO - I want you to protect that place.

VN - What about Killer Bean? What do you want me to do?

CO - Oh nothing.

CO - Just send him a box of chocolates, and tell him thanks for the memories.

CO - You idiot!

CO - What do you think you should do?

CO - Kill him.

CO - Any way you can, by any means.

CO - Put him in the ground!

VN - I'll need more beans. Professional beans.

CO - Put it on my credit card, okay.

CO - Just do it!

VN - Yes, sir.

CO - Vagan.

CO - Make sure you find out who sent him.

CO - There will be hell to pay.

HR - Hello.

DC - Hey, Harry. It's Detective Cromwell.

HR - Hey, Cromwell.

DC - Hey did you get the package I sent you?

HR - Yeah, it's pretty wild stuff.

DC - Our crime lab is getting nowhere with this.

DC - What do you make of it?

HR - Well, the easy ones the tire tread sample.

HR - I tested the residue you sent, and the tires are made from silicon steel fiber alloy.

HR - It's only used on high-performance cars. It's not unique, but it's hard to come by.

DC - Hmm... What about the gold bullets?

HR - Now that.

HR - In my 15 years with Special Forces, I've never seen gold used in any weapon.

HR - But for practical purposes gold is a very soft metal.

HR - So the bullets expand and deform on high impact.

HR - They make little holes on the way in and big holes on the way out.

HR - And they are much harder to match the ballistic signatures.

HR - That makes them relatively untraceable.

DC - Yeah, that doesn't make sense if the bullet casings have his name on it. And he left those everywhere.

HR - Yeah. Killer Bean. Yeah, I don't get that.

HR - He must be one sick bean, like he wanted to be found out.

DC - Yeah, or he's bragging. Or just plain careless.

DC - This Killer Bean has to be working for someone to get that kind of financial backing. You HR - think he's a gun for hire?

DC - Or he could be a vigilante. That's the word on the street.

DC - Either way, one thing's for sure. He has his eyes set on Cappuccino.

HR - Heh, well then you both have something in common.

DC - Yeah. If that's true,

DC - I have a hunch where this Killer Bean will show up next.

DC - Hey, I gotta go. See you, Harry.

HR - Later.

'Suspected Cappuccino's Warehouses'

KB - Dramatic entrance... Dramatic entrance...

KB - Well, that pretty much frees up my day.

KB - Time for some breakfast.

'Shadow Bean, you are too late.'

BT - Howdy. What will it be?

KB - Tequila and tonic.

KB - And, uh. Turn up the TV.

RP - Detective Cromwell, concerning possible suspects,

RP - rumors have surfaced that there is a vigilante bean in town, who is hunting down Cappuccino.

DC - There is no evidence for your vigilante theory. As far as I'm concerned,

DC - the suspect or suspects involved in these homicides are no friends of the police.

DC - We will do what is necessary to bring them to justice. Thank you.

KB - I don't think so.

KB - I'll have another. And you can turn that crap off now.

What can I get you?

DC - I'll have what he's having.

DC - This is a rough part of town. Do you always sit with your back to the entrance?

DC - Doesn't matter who comes in.

KB - Isn't it against police regulation to be drinking during the day?

DC - I'm a detective. Our regulations are a little different.

DC - How'd you know I was with the police?

KB - You know, you're much uglier in person.

DC - Heh.

DC - My name is Detective Cromwell. And you are?

KB - Jack.

DC - Well, Jack...

DC - I guess you heard what happened this morning over at the warehouse on Baker Street.

KB - Yeah, I know about that.

DC - Really. Tell me what you know.

KB - Why don't we cut to the chase.

KB - Why don't you tell me what you know.

DC - Oh, I know a lot.

DC - I know the Baker Street warehouse is owned by Cappuccino.

DC - I know someone killed 12 beans in that warehouse last night.

DC - I know the killer drove a fancy car, and has fancy guns.

DC - I know that the warehouse across the street with the big hole in the window also belongs to Cappuccino.

DC - I see this fancy car parked in front, and well, you don't look like you walked here.

DC - So my guess is...

DC - This, belongs to you.

KB - Well it looks like you figured it all out.

KB - Good job.

KB - Another!

DC - It was easy. You were just reckless.

KB - The way I see it, you're the one who's being reckless.

KB - You come out here looking for me by yourself. You didn't bring anyone to back you up. That's reckless.

DC - Here's my backup.

KB - That's a nice gun.

KB - Wanna see mine!

DC - How can I see it, if you have it against the side of my head?

DC - Not bad.

DC - But mine's bigger.

KB - You do the math.

DC - Why are you after Cappuccino?

KB - That's for me to know, and you not to know.

DC - Well, I know I can't have a crazy vigilante running around shooting up beans.

DC - But you're no vigilante, are you.

DC - Seems like there are beans who've invested in you,

DC - And I'm sure they're not happy with the press you're getting.

DC - This is where I can help you.

KB - I don't need help.

DC - Well, you see. I'm bound by the law.

DC - I've been working this Cappuccino case for over three years.

DC - Every time we think we have something on him, his lawyers get in the way and get him out.

DC - I wish I was like you.

DC - I wish I could just walk up to him and shoot him.

DC - But I can't.

DC - It's too bad.

DC - Because I know where is central warehouse is.

DC - Not these abandoned warehouses, like that one out there.

DC - Why don't you pay him a visit?

KB - You got the wrong bean. I'm not just some hired gun.

DC - Who says I'm hiring you?

DC - You already have a boss, don't you?

DC - I bet he doesn't really like all that attention that you're getting from the media.

DC - I can make that go away.

DC - I control the evidence,

DC - and the evidence says it could've been some rival gang that killed all of Cappuccino's beans last night, or...

DC - It could be you.

DC - And I have a lot of evidence that says that.

KB - Are you going to take me in?

DC - I can take you down.

KB - Oh... I would enjoy that.

BT - Freeze!

BT - Get out of my bar you punks! I know how to use this!

DC - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold on! I'm a cop!

DC - Put down your gun!

BT - I don't trust any of you.

BT - You drop your guns, both of you!

KB - Sorry, grandpa. It doesn't work like that.

DC - Okay, okay.

DC - I'm going to slowly lower my gun,

DC - and I'm gonna go, alright? Alright?

DC - This will be real easy.

DC - See?

DC - This is easy.

DC - Killer Bean.

DC - Remember what I said.

DC - We can help each other.

KB - Just help yourself out the door.

KB - This is for the drinks. Mine and his.

KB - Now, you mind if I go to the bathroom before I go?

BT - Be quick. Your life depends on it.

KB - So dramatic.

KB - Sorry. It was a double flusher.

BT - But you only flushed once.

KB - Hey... Don't I know you from somewhere?

DC - Who is Shadow Bean?

KB - You're in way over your head.

DC - Who is Shadow Bean?!

KB - You don't have to yell. I'm right next to you.

DC - Answer me! Are there two of yous?!

KB - You're not going to shoot me if you need the answers.

KB - Besides, I can't answer you anyway. So...

KB - I'll have to do this instead!

KB - It's a good idea for you to stay down.

DC - We'll settle this later.

KB - You're not as dumb as you look.

HR - Hello.

DC - Harry. It's Cromwell.

DC - My hunch was right.

DC - Killer Bean hit Cappuccino's warehouse on the east side.

DC - In fact, he was still here when I got here.

HR - Whoa, how did that go?

DC - Not as well as I would have liked.

DC - Hey listen. I got some new info. I found a note in front of Cappuccino's warehouse.

DC - It said, Shadow Bean, you are too late.

DC - Does that mean anything to you?

DC - Harry? You still there?

HR - I didn't know they were still in operation.

DC - Who?

HR - The Shadow Beans.

DC - Harry, what's going on?

HR - They're highly trained operatives of an organization called the Shadow Agency.

DC - Shadow Agency? What are they, a government agency? Why haven't I heard of them?

HR - I think they were a private organization.

HR - There are some things the government does that are not meant to be known.

HR - Their collaboration with the Shadow Agency was one of them.

HR - When diplomatic and military tactics failed,

HR - our government hired the Shadow Agency to eliminate national security threats.

HR - It was more cost effective than training and maintaining our own elite assassins.

HR - And the Shadow Beans were better than anything we had.

DC - Great.

DC - But why here?

DC - What are the Shadow Beans doing in Beantown?

DC - And what could they possibly want with Cappuccino?

HR - I don't know. I thought the Shadow Agency was disbanded.

HR - I know our government stopped using them nearly a decade ago.

HR - I haven't heard of them since.

DC - So do you think this Killer Bean is a Shadow Bean operative?

HR - It sounds like he's certainly good enough to be.

What do you think I should do is stop him?

HR - I don't even know if you can't stop him.

HR - But you can start by putting all your cops on double duty.

DC - Right...

KB - This is the place.

KB - Dramatic entrance.

VG 1 - Bean, I hate this job.

VG 1 - It's so freaking boring.

VG 1 - All we do we sit around and drink beer.

VG 2 - Are you kidding? This is my dream job!

VG 3 - Hey! We're not supposed to be just sitting around drinking beer.

VG 3 - Remember what Vagan said? He said we got to move all those crates by morning.

VG 3 - If the cops find this stuff, we are screwed.

VG 2 - Where are we supposed to move them?

VG 3 - I don't know. I didn't really listen to that part.

VG 2 - Hey, give me another beer.

VG 4 - Oh here, have mine. I shouldn't drink anymore.

VG 4 - *sniff*

VG 4 - *cough*

VG 4 - I have a really bad cold.

VG 2 - All right!

VG 2 - Wait... is this a low carb beer?

VG 3 - Hey, speaking of beer...

VG 3 - Did you beans hear what happened at the party last night?

VG 3 - Some dude went in there, and killed everyone.

VG 3 - He even killed Cappuccino's nephew.

VG 4 - Geez...

VG 4 - Who was this bean that killed everyone?

VG 4 - Is he someone I should be worried about?

VG 3 - Nah. He's probably just some crazed lunatic, running around with lots of guns.

VG 3 - You know, that's the problem with this country.

VG 3 - Too many crazed lunatics with guns.

VG 3 - Isn't that right, baby?

VG 4 - The lunatics aren't the problem.

VG 4 - The real problem is the guns.

VG 4 - What this country needs is some serious gun control.

VG 4 - I mean, we need to take away all the guns. All of them! And just get rid of them!

VG 4 - But not my gun.

KB - Ohhh! Gah!

KB - Ow!

VG 3 - Bean, you dropped into the wrong place.

VG 3 - Looks like what we got here is a standoff.

KB - Not really.

VG 5 - Over there!

VG 5 - Take cover!

VG 5 - Call the boss! Get some help!

VN - Hello.

VG 6 - Vagan! We're being attacked. I think it's Killer Bean!

VN - How do you know?

VG 6 - Well...

VG 6 - He's killing everyone!

VN - We're sending the mercenaries. Just hold tight.

VG 5 - Keep firing! Don't let up!

VG 5 - Grenade!!

ML - I can see we came to the right place.

ML - You made short work of these beans.

ML - Don't expect the same fight from us.

ML - My squad has been with me through hell.

ML - I hand selected them myself from the Academy ten years ago.

ML - All of them graduated with top honors.

ML - I led these beans through three tours of duty,

ML - accumulating a total of 15 Medals of Honor, 11 Purple Hearts.

ML - Sure, we lost a few good beans...

ML - But you should see what we did to the other bloke.

ML - Well, then we went into business for ourselves.

ML - Escort detail for high-level dignitaries,

ML - Hostage extraction, corporate assassinations, preemptive surgical strikes,

ML - Or just plain search and destroy.

ML - Heck, we even robbed a few federal banks with business with slow.

ML - So...

ML - So this little shindig we got here...

ML - Oh, it's nothing.

ML - It's just a walk in the park.

ML - Are you going to say something or what?

KB - Huh?

KB - Oh, I'm sorry. I must have totally zoned out on you.

KB - Whoa, my eyes are starting to water. Whoo!

KB - Sorry.

KB - Let's make one thing clear. Last night was a party.

KB - Tonight, I get to work!

KB - Decaffeinated.

DC - Oh well.

DC - It was worth a try.

VN - This is not a good idea. We should kill him now.

CO - Patience, Vagan.

CO - I need answers.

CO - I need answers from him.

VN - He's awake.

CO - So.

CO - This is the great Killer Bean.

KB - Yeah.

CO - You attack my warehouses.

CO - You kill my beans.

CO - What do you want from me?!

KB - My guns would be nice.

KB - Better enjoy a while it lasts, tough guy.

CO - Tough words from a bean who is helpless.

KB - Ohhh...

KB - No, you did not!

KB - Okay. Maybe you did.

CO - What do you want, Killer Bean? Who are you working for?

KB - What. You expect me to just blurt it all out?

CO - My nephew was at the Baker Street warehouse when you attacked it, okay.

CO - I think you owe me an explanation.

KB - Your nephew?

KB - Hmm... Your nephew...

CO - He was such a good boy.

CO - He wanted to be a DJ as some big nightclub.

CO - I told him, someday I'll buy you your own my club.

CO - As long as you sell my drugs there.

CO - Eh, the profit sharing we never agreed on.

CO - But you know, he was such a sweet kid.

KB - Oh yeah. Yeah remember him.

KB - He was the one playing the music.

CO - He always loved his music.

KB - Well, he's dead now.

CO - Kill this bean. He's wasting my time.

VN - It's about time.

CG - How does it feel to be killed,

CG - by your own gun?

KB - Funny...

KB - I was about to ask you the same thing.

VN - Are we done playing games for today?

DC - Finally...

DO - Dispatch.

DC - This is Cromwell.

DO - Roger, Detective Cromwell.

DC - I need backup. I'm at 43rd and Main Street.

DO - Right away, sir.

DC - There's no rush.

DC - I got time.

DC - Cromwell out.

CO - How dare you!

CO - How dare you come onto my property, looking to kill me!

CO - Who do you think you are?

KB - Hate to burst your bubble, Cappuccino...

KB - but I'm not here to kill you.

CO - What?

KB - I'm here to kill him.

KB - You just got in my way.

CO - I don't understand.

CO - You want to kill him?

CO - No me?

DC - What the hell is going on?

DC - Just shoot him already.

KB - It's complicated.

KB - Why don't you just beat it.

CO - No. I'm quite interested to knowing why.

KB - Fine. You wanna die too?

KB - Believe me, it's no trouble at all.

CO - Actually, uh...

CO - I think that my estimated taxes are due soon.

CO - I like to stay on top of that stuff.

KB - Good idea.

CO - Oh.

CO - By the way.

CO - Vagan?

CO - You're fired!!

VN - It's about time they sent someone with some talent after me.

KB - Nothing but the best for you, Dark Bean.

VN - Yeah. I guess they finally learned it's gonna take the best.

DC - What the hell is going on?

KB - You were one of the Shadow Agency's top beans.

KB - I used to look up to you.

KB - Now I have to kill you.

KB - Why did you betray us, Dark Bean?

VN - I didn't betray anyone.

VN - The Shadow Agency betrayed me.

KB - What?

KB - You're the one who destroyed our database, and stole years of intelligence work. How could you do that?

KB - And how could you go from policing the world to running guns for this two-bit gangster?

VN - Why did you join the Shadow Agency, Killer Bean?

KB - To get rid of the trash in this world, one bullet at a time.

VN - Yeah, we all joined for the same reason.

VN - But when I joined the Shadow Agency 12 years ago,

VN - It was more clear cut.

VN - Our job was to neutralize threats, while the politicians were paralyzed in diplomatic bullshit.

KB - That's just the way I like it.

VN - Times have changed.

VN - The agency was always privately controlled,

VN - But originally we always worked with the government to protect our citizens.

VN - Then it all changed.

VN - I'm not sure what caused the shift but now,

VN - we're just guns for hire, providing services to the highest bidder.

VN - Anyone with the right amount of money can buy the talents of the Shadow Beans.

VN - On one mission, I was asked to protect some rich dictator.

VN - On another, I assassinated an opposing leader.

VN - It didn't matter what we did.

VN - The Shadow Agency always convinced us that what we did was for the right reasons.

VN - But before I left, they had me deliver weapons to the very group of beans I had spent several years trying to take down.

VN - That was it for me.

KB - Do you expect me to believe any of this?

KB - All I know is that you breached the agency's security, and stole years of intelligence work.

VN - I didn't steal anything.

VN - All the information I took was mine.

VN - I wasn't about to give up 12 years of sweat and blood. I needed it to continue my work.

KB - And exactly how does serving Cappuccino continue your work?

VN - Cappuccino is a major player in the weapons market.

VN - Posing as his lackey puts me on the inside.

VN - I can find out who wants what, who sells what, and where the big threats are.

VN - But unlike at the Shadow Agency, I can finally kill the beans who deserve to be killed.

KB - You got yourself a few more minutes of life with that story, Dark Bean.

KB - But you can't out talk my trigger finger.

VN - It doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

VN - This is probably your last mission.

VN - If I don't kill you, the Shadow Agency will.

KB - What the hell are you talking about? I'm one of their best Shadow Beans.

KB - Why would they want me dead?

VN - The Shadow Agency knows I could expose them.

VN - Any agent that comes in contact with me is compromised.

VN - And from what I've been hearing,

VN - You've been a liability to the agency since the day you started.

VN - Seeing the mess you made last night confirms that the Shadow Agency has a hard time controlling you.

VN - They must know you joined for the same reasons I did.

VN - They know it's only a matter of time before you find out the truth about them.

VN - And if they can't control you now, how will they control you when you do find out?

VN - It's smarter for them to diffuse you now, before you become a bigger problem.

KB - If they wanted me dead, then why even send me on this mission?

VN - You said it yourself. You're one of their best.

VN - They tried to kill me before. They sent Shadow Beans after me twice.

VN - They both failed.

VN - Think about it, Killer Bean.

VN - They want us both dead, and we're hard to kill.

VN - Regardless of the outcome of this mission, the agency gets what they want.

VN - Because one of us will be eliminated.

KB - No, no. You're lying.

KB - I'm not gonna believe you. I won't believe a word you say.

VN - I had to take the shot.

VN - I would have done more with my life than you ever will.

VN - Doesn't matter now.

VN - We're both dead beans.

DO - Dispatch.

DC - This is Cromwell. Where's my backup?

DO - 6 squad cars eta 3 minutes, 2 special assault units in 5.

DC - Get me more.

DO - How many, sir?

DC - Everyone.

JB - Yes?

JB - Yes, I am here.

'Deactivated'

JB - And who is the target?

'Deactivated'

JB - No. No problem at all.

JB - I've always wanted to meet him.

JB - I'll call you when the job is done.

'Secure Connection'

PB 1 - Drop your guns!

PB 1 - Put em down, now!

KB - It's not gonna end like this.

PB 1 - Drop your guns!

DC - Whoa, whoa ,whoa! Easy, hold your fire!

KB - Finally brought some backup, huh.

DC - Yeah. Does this satisfy your ego?

KB - What do you want, Cromwell? Coming to see if I did your dirty work?

KB - He's right over there.

DC - Yeah, he's dead all right.

DC - But you didn't kill him.

DC - He did.

KB - What does it matter?

KB - You got the results you wanted. Now just step aside and let me by.

DC - Let you by?

DC - You're the key to this whole mess.

DC - If I let you go, I'll never find out about the Shadow Agency, or the Shadow Beans.

KB - I can't help you.

DC - Why not?

DC - You are Shadow Bean, aren't you?

KB - Not anymore.

DC - They're coming after you, aren't they.

DC - Don't shoot! Hold your fire!

DC - If you tell me what I need to know, I can protect you.

KB - I highly doubt that.

DC - I can at least give you a place to stay tonight.

DC - Let me help you, Killer Bean.

KB - There is nothing you can do that will help me.

KB - But I do need a quiet place to think.

KB - Not exactly what I had in mind, but this will do.

DC - Make yourself at home. This will keep you safe for the night.

DC - Hell, it'll probably keep us safe too.

KB - I don't plan on staying long.

DC - I'll be back in the morning. We have a lot to talk about.

PB 2 - Who were these guys? I'd like to know where they get guns like this.

PB 3 - Hey, don't touch that stuff. You know better than that. You're contaminating the evidence.

PB 2 - I don't think we're going to have a shortage of evidence here.

PB 3 - Whoa, hold it! This is a crime scene. No one is allowed on the premises.

PB 2 - Yeah. Nobody ordered no egg foo yung here.

JB - Where is Killer Bean?

PB 2 - Killer Bean? We put his ass in the slammer.

PB 3 - Wait.

PB 3 - Who are you?

PB 2 - Let me put it in a language you can understand.

PB 2 - So sorry. No chow mein here. You deliver wrong place.

PB 3 - Get your hands in the air! Put them up, now!

PB 3 - Now put your hands on your head, drop to your knees.

DC - Commander. Thanks for your help.

DC - I'm turning in for the night. I'll be back in the morning.

PB 1 - Right, sir. We'll be here when you get back.

DC - Excellent.

PB 1 - What do we got here?

PB 3 - Just some punk bean we caught assaulting an officer.

PB 1 - Well he sure picked the wrong night to do that.

PB 1 - Take him in.

PB 1 - Hold it! Another move, and we drop you!

PB 1 - Take him out!

JB - These are very nice guns.

KB - Are you sure you want to do that?

JB - You need them more than I do.

KB - So you're the bean they sent to kill me.

JB - Mmm hmm.

KB - Who are you?

JB - I am Jet Bean. Assassin from the East.

KB - I completed my mission. Why do they want me dead?

JB - They don't tell me why.

JB - And I don't ask.

KB - They decided to kill me the moment they sent me on this mission, didn't they.

KB - That's what Dark Bean told me.

KB - The agency knew that once I found out the truth about them, they couldn't trust me.

KB - They were right.

JB - Save your breath, Killer Bean.

JB - You're going to need it.

KB - Don't you know what the Shadow Agency is? Don't you realize how they're using us?

JB - I can see you've been brainwashed by Dark Bean.

JB - He was a fool.

JB - No one Shadow Bean can threaten the agency.

KB - But I'm no Shadow Bean.

JB - I certainly hope you trained harder than that.

JB - Well...

JB - At least you're in the fighting mood now.

JB - You have been a formidable opponent.

JB - I am sorry I have to end this game.

JB - You already tried that.

KB - It's over.

JB - Not for you.

'Secure Connection'

KB - Jet Bean, is your mission complete?

KB - Jet Bean is dead.

SA - Killer Bean...

KB - I learned a lot about the Shadow Agency today.

KB - And it's not for me.

KB - I quit.

SA - Don't be rash. Think about what you are doing.

SA - Why don't you come in? We can talk things over.

KB - Oh, I'm coming in. But it won't be for talking.

KB - This will do.
